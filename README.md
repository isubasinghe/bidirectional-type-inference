# Bidirectional Type Inference and Checking 
Type inference is at the core of modern programming languages. 
One way to achieve type inference is through Hindley-Milner inference. 
Another way is ''bidirectional type inference''. 

## Why?
Dunfield and Krishnaswami outline:
  * Decidable even for very expressive type systems (unlike Damas-Milner)
  * Error Reporting
  * Scalability 
  * Relative ease of implementation
  * Sound 
  * Complete
