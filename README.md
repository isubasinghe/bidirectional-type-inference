# Bidirectional Type Inference and Checking 
Type inference is at the core of modern programming languages. 
One way to achieve type inference is through Hindley-Milner inference. 
Another way is ''bidirectional type inference''.

## What? 
A tutorial into Dunfield and Krishnaswami's work on Bidirectional Type Checking/Inference for higher rank polymorphism. 

## Why?
Dunfield and Krishnaswami outline:
  * Decidable even for very expressive type systems (unlike Damas-Milner)
  * Error Reporting
  * Scalability 
  * Relative ease of implementation
  * Sound 
  * Complete 

## How to compile?
Simple run `make` to generate the pdf, tex and executable files. 
If you just want to obtain the pdf run `make pdf`. 
If you just want to obtain the executable run `make tinfer`.

A detailed, from scratch tutorial is provided here [here](./eval.pdf)
